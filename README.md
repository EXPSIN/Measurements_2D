# MATLAB Simulation of LiDAR-equipped Robot in Cluttered 2D Environment
﻿
This MATLAB script simulates a LiDAR-equipped mobile robot navigating in a cluttered 2D environment with obstacles.
﻿
## Overview
﻿
- **Map**: Loads a binary obstacle map (`map01.bmp`) to define a cluttered environment.
- **Motion**: The robot follows a circular path, continuously updating its position and orientation.
- **LiDAR-based Visualization**: Plots the robot’s trajectory and dynamically detects nearby obstacles within a specified range.
﻿
## Usage
﻿
1. Place `map01.bmp` in the working directory.
2. Run the script to visualize:
- Obstacles (black pixels in the map)
- LiDAR-detected range (shaded regions)
- The robot's trajectory as it navigates the cluttered environment
